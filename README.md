# Money Tracker 
This repository contains the source code for a money tracker app created by Artur Kopytin for Android using Java. The app allows users to track their income and expenses and view their financial history. The app is fully connected with Firebase, and Google login is used to provide a seamless and secure user authentication experience.

## Features
The app includes the following features:

- User authentication using Google login
- Add, edit and delete income and expenses
- View a list of all transactions and sort them by date, amount, category, type, and more.
- View a summary of total income and expenses for a selected period of time
- The app is built using the MVVM architecture pattern, which allows for separation of concerns and easy testing.
- Firebase Authentication and Realtime Database for storing user data and authentication
- RxJava for asynchronous programming, which made it easy to avoid memory leaks and keep the app responsive
- Fragments and FragmentManager for creating reusable UI components and enhancing app modularity
- Glide for image loading and caching
